Now we do face big data issue as internet information size that we collect and process grows quickly, currently there are many solutions developed
 to analyze and mine valuable treasure in diverse and useless garbage data. Hadoop \cite{5496972} and MapReduce \cite{Dean:2008:MSD:1327452.1327492} are famous 
and effective solutions, they give programmer user-friendly and compact batch processing module. 

Mapreduce mainly involves batch processing technique on shared and parallel cluster meaning it works statically 
and event triggered. But MapReduce cannot provide low latency response when it process continous and real-time data stream \cite{Babcock:2002:MID:543613.543615}.
To overcome this disadvantage, several stream processing system have been proposed, e.g. Storm \cite{Aniello:2013:AOS:2488222.2488267}
 and S4 \cite{5693297}. The abvious difference between MapReduce and Storm is that a MapReduce job will finally finish, while Storm job will keep on working until be stoped by user.  

\section{Storm}

Storm attributes distributed realtime stream processing framework with scalable, reliable and
 fault tolerant computation, it can act excellently on many use cases like: realtime analytics, online machine learning, ETL, and 
more. For these surprising features, Many companies such as Twitter choose Storm as solution for data processing.
